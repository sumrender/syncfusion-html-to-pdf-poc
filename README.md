I want to repeat the entire header.

{{{this.HeaderRowOne}}}
{{{this.HeaderRowTwo}}}


Currently, if my header exceeds a certain height, it stops repeating. Please give a solution
as this is a business requirement.


I want to be able to print 'want.pdf' with full repeating headers but I'm currently stuck with 'current.pdf'
